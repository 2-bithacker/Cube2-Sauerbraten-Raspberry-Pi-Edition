If you are running raspberry pi os with a 64 bit kernel, you will not have to build.  To download, run `git clone https://github.com/2-bithacker/Cube2-Sauerbraten-Raspberry-Pi-Edition.git`

To launch, you have to set the binary excecutable and maybe the launcher.  Set the binary excecutable with `cd ~/Cube2-Sauerbraten-Raspberry-Pi-Edition/bin_unix && chmod +x native_client`

To set the launcher excecutable, run `cd ~/Cube2-Sauerbraten-Raspberry-Pi-Edition && chmod +x sauerbraten_unix`

To download, build, create a dektop launcher, and set it all excecutable, run `git clone https://github.com/2-bithacker/Cube2-Sauerbraten-Raspberry-Pi-Edition.git && cd ~/Cube2-Sauerbraten-Raspberry-Pi-Edition && chmod +x install && ./install`
